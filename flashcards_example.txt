<h2 class="card-question-text" itemprop="name text">What is the nature of sunlight?</h2>	<h3 class="card-answer-text" itemprop="text">Sunlight is a form of electromagnetic radiation and the visible light we see is a small subset of the electromagnetic spectrum.</h3>
<h2 class="card-question-text" itemprop="name text">Who were the key figures that demonstrated light as a wave in the early 1800's?</h2>	<h3 class="card-answer-text" itemprop="text">Thomas Young, Fran√ßois Arago, and Augustin Jean Fresnel.</h3>
<h2 class="card-question-text" itemprop="name text">What problem arose in the late 1800's with the wave-based view of light?</h2>	<h3 class="card-answer-text" itemprop="text">Experiments measuring the spectrum of wavelengths from heated objects could not be explained using the wave-based equations of light.</h3>
<h2 class="card-question-text" itemprop="name text">Who resolved the discrepancy in the wave-based view of light and how?</h2>	<h3 class="card-answer-text" itemprop="text">The discrepancy was resolved by the works of Max Planck in 1900 and Albert Einstein in 1905. Planck proposed that the total energy of light is made up of indistinguishable energy elements, or quanta. Einstein correctly determined the values of these quantum energy elements while examining the photoelectric effect.</h3>
<h2 class="card-question-text" itemprop="name text">How is light explained in quantum mechanics?</h2>	<h3 class="card-answer-text" itemprop="text">In quantum mechanics, light consists of photons, which are most accurately pictured as "wave-packets" that may appear either as waves or particles depending on the situation. This concept is called wave-particle duality.</h3>
<h2 class="card-question-text" itemprop="name text">What is a wave-packet?</h2>	<h3 class="card-answer-text" itemprop="text">A wave-packet is a collection of waves which may interact in such a way that it appears either spatially localized (acting as a particle) or simply as a wave. In essence, it's a quantum-mechanical description of particles like photons.</h3>
<h2 class="card-question-text" itemprop="name text">Why is a complete physical description of the properties of light required?</h2>	<h3 class="card-answer-text" itemprop="text">A complete physical description of the properties of light requires quantum-mechanical analysis, since light is a type of quantum-mechanical particle called a photon.</h3>
